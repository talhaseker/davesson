# Description:

Dave Davesson is a platform game that comes in two flavors: Single player and multiplayer. The main goal of the single player mode is to pass the dangers throughout the level and to open the door for advancing into a new level. In order to open the door one must also grab the key, which is placed in the current map in a specific and uncanny spot. After that Dave can pass to a new level. Based on the goods that the player collects and the maximum level reached, a score will be created and if the playerâ€™s score is high enough, he/she can write a name on the high scores board. The second flavor, is played with two players. In this mode the players, the members of the Davesson family fight with each other with different weapons that have different fire rate and damage points.
	In addition to basic game modes, the user will be able to save and load his/her own game from any state. Also, the user can select the map that he/she wants to play in single player, or multiplayer to compete with others.
